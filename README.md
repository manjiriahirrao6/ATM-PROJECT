# ATM System

Welcome to the ATM System project! This C++ program simulates the functionality of an ATM machine, allowing users to perform various banking operations.

## Features
- User authentication with PIN verification
- Check account balance
- Deposit funds into the account
- Withdraw funds from the account
- Transfer funds between accounts (if supported by the bank)
- Change PIN

The ATM System project replicates the functionality of a real-world ATM machine, providing users with a secure and convenient banking experience. Upon launching the program, users are prompted to authenticate themselves using a Personal Identification Number (PIN), ensuring that only authorized individuals can access their accounts. Once authenticated, users can perform a variety of banking operations such as checking their account balance, depositing funds into their account, and withdrawing funds as needed. Additionally, the system supports inter-account transfers, allowing users to transfer funds between their accounts if this feature is supported by their bank. Furthermore, users have the option to change their PIN for added security. With an intuitive user interface and robust functionality, the ATM System project offers a reliable solution for managing personal finances efficiently.
